# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description : 
  - two players, a user and a computer.
  - both players choose either rock, paper, or scissors.
  - the player that reaches 5 points first wins the game.
  - if both the user and computer makes the same selection, no points are awarded to either one.

## Things I enjoyed about this project :
  - Building the layout for the game with HTML/CSS.
  - planning out my approach for writing the code.

## Some of the challenges I've faced throughout this project : 
  - figuring out how the computer must generate a random selection.
  - how to display the text of the winner of the game.

## My approach of overcoming the challenges : 
  - doing proper research to figure out the solution.
  - testing my code to ensure the program is doing what it must.
